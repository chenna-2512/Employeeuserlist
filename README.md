# React + Vite

To run the frontend, navigate to your project folder using `cd your-project-folder`, then install dependencies if they are not already installed by running `npm install`. Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server using `npm run dev`, which will launch your React app (likely powered by Vite) on a local server, typically at `http://localhost:5173/`. Open this URL in your browser to view the application. Let me know if you run into any issues! ðŸš€
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
